          abstract = {Model transformations are increasingly being incorporated in software development processes. However, as systems being developed with transformations grow in size and complexity, the performance of the transformations tends to degrade. In this paper we investigate the factors that have an impact on the execution performance of model transformations. We analyze the performance of three model transformation language engines, namely ATL, QVT Operational Mappings and QVT Relations. We implemented solutions to two transformation problems in these languages and compared the performance of these transformations. We extracted metric values from the transformations to systematically analyze how their characteristics influence transformation execution performance. We also implemented a solution to a transformation problem in ATL in three functionally equivalent ways, but with different language constructs to evaluate the effect of language constructs on transformation performance. The results of this paper enable a transformation designer to estimate beforehand the performance of a transformation, and to choose among implementation alternatives to achieve the best performance. In addition, transformation engine developers may find some of our results useful in order to tune their tools for better performance.},

          abstract = {Model-Driven Engineering is a software development process that has gained popularity in the recent years. Unlike traditional software engineering processes, MDE is centered around models, instead of code. By using model transformations, models can be translated from one language to another, resulting in a separation of program architecture and execution platform. However, an increase in size of any of the elements required by the transformation process might lead to performance problems. Although these problems are common and well known in the eld of software engineering, problems specic to MDE have not yet been investigated in sucient depth.
In this research, we compare the performance of three model transformation engines. These tools allow the transformation of models to be specied in ATL, QVT Operational Mappings and QVT Relations. Furthermore, dierent implementation strategies are evaluated to determine how language constructs aect the performance of the model transformation process.

The implementation of model transformation engines determines the performance of the language. Increases of model size and complexity cause transformations to run slower, yet some transformation engines are aected more than others. ATL is the fastest performing language, followed by QVTo and QVTr in this order.

Language constructs often allow developers to dene the same model transformation in multiple ways. High metric values for the number of attribute helpers, and low values for the number of calls to allInstances() indicate better performance in ATL transformations. High values for the number of called rules metric suggests an imperative specication style, resulting in a negative impact on performance.

The results from this research allow transformation designers to estimate the perfor- mance of their transformation denitions. Developers of model transformation tools can use our results to improve the current version of their tools.},

	standard notations that dont pertain to the MDA space, we first need
	to provide some justification about this work. The global organization
	of technological spaces presented at the beginning of the paper is
	intended to answer this first question. Furthermore we propose the
	original characterization of a technological space as a framework
	based on a given unique metamodel. After having briefly presented
	the ATL framework, we describe the XSLT2XQuery transformation. We
	may then draw several conclusions from this experiment, suggesting
	possible improvements to general model transformation frameworks.
	ATL is still evolving since it is supposed to match the forthcoming
	QVT/RFP recommendation when it is ready. As a consequence, the concrete
	expression of the transformation presented in this paper may change,
	but the general ideas should remain stable.},

	This study focuses on analyzing model size and complexity and metrics
	related to model quality and effort. Furthermore, project team members
	were asked to elaborate on their views on the impact of using MDD.
	Our findings include that larger models are more complex, contain
	more diagrams, are changed more often and worked on longer but do
	not necessarily contain more defects. However, models that are changed
	often do contain more defects. Benefits mentioned by team members
	were an increase in productivity, benefits from a consistent implementation
	and their perception of improvement of overall quality. Also, a reduction
	in complexity was attributed to the use of MDD techniques. We could
	confirm the perceived increase in the quality of the product in that
	the average amount of defects found is significantly lower than in
	similar size projects in which MDD was not employed.},

  howpublished = {Online},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {The term grammar-based software describes software whose input can
	
	be specified by a context-free grammar. This grammar may occur explicitly
	in the
	
	software, in the form of an input specification to a parser generator,
	or implicitly,
	
	in the form of a hand-written parser. Grammar-based software includes
	not only
	
	programming language compilers, but also tools for program analysis,
	reverse engineering,
	
	software metrics and documentation generation. Hence, ensuring their
	
	completeness and correctness is a vital prerequisite for their use.
	In this paper we
	
	propose a strategy for the construction of test suites for grammar
	based software, and
	
	illustrate this strategy using the ISO C++ grammar. We use the concept
	of grammar rule
	
	coverage as a pivot for the reduction of an implementation-based test
	suite, and
	
	demonstrate a significant decrease in the size of this suite. The
	effectiveness of this
	
	reduced test suite is compared to the original test suite with respect
	to code coverage
	
	and more importantly, fault detection. This work greatly expands upon
	previous
	
	work in this area and utilizes large scale mutation testing to compare
	the effectiveness
	
	of grammar-rule coverage to that of statement coverage as a reduction
	criterion
	
	for test suites of grammar-based software. This work finds that when
	grammar rule
	
	coverage is used as the sole criterion for reducing test suites of
	grammar based
	
	software, the fault detection capability of that reduced test suite
	is greatly diminished
	
	when compared to other coverage criteria such as statement coverage.},

	\begin{description}[\setlabelwidth{Class Count and Modeling Effort}]
	
	\item[Counts count] The authors argue that counts are important metrics
	for model measurement and define a model-driven framework that incorporates
	these count metrics.
	
	\item[Measuring the Level of] \item[Abstraction and Detail] \item[of
	Models in the context of MDD] The authors define models as being
	graphs and model transformations as graph transformations. The size
	of model M is then the number of vertexes + the number of edges +
	1 (the graph itself). They continue by defining metrics according
	to this graph view.
	
	\item[On the Relation between] \item[Class Count and Modeling Effort]
	The authors research whether using just class count within a model
	is sufficient to say something about the complexity of a model. The
	result is that this is not the case, an explanation is given for
	this.
	
	\item[Effort distribution in] \item[model based development] The authors
	aim to find how much effort is given per phase in the software engineering
	process. They find that most effort is put in implementation (38\%),
	followed by project management (13\%), testing (12\%), analysis and
	design (11\%) and requirements engineering (8\%). They compare their
	findings with the RUP hump diagrams and find that these are ``surprisingly
	accurate''. They do note that the original RUP hump diagrams are
	not drawn for model-based development.
	
	\item[Complexity Measurement] \item[of Goal Driven Requirements] The
	author proposes a metric for requirement complexity. He finds that
	``goal-driven analysis would provide better estimation at the requirements
	level than function points''.
